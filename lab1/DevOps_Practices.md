# DevOps Practices
DevOps is a set of practices that combine the software development stage (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). with the aim of shortening the system development life cycle and providing continuous delivery, ensuring high software quality.

**Some examples of DevOps practice**:
## Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Infrastructure as code is a DevOps practice that automates infrastructure configuration, insted of doing it manually  reducing human error and speed, using tools like Terraform or ansible for high-level data center provision.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
CI/CD is the practice of delivering applications to customers on a regular basis by introducing automation into the application development stages. The key concepts of CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is the solution to the problems that integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams, example gitlab,  github.


## Switch to Microservices:
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable services, organized by capabilities. business and owned by a small group. Microservice architecture enables fast, frequent, and reliable delivery of large, complex applications.


## Monitoring The Right Metrics: 
Monitoring and logging involves collecting, processing, aggregating and displaying real-time data on software, thereby providing visibility into application performance, operational efficiency and behavior of the user. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for capturingmetrics and logs are commonly used for this activity.


## Build a Collaborative Culture:
One of the key aspects of DevOps is promoting better communication and collaboration between the development and operations teams. This can be achieved through practices like daily stand-ups or using chat applications that promote instant communication and sharing of information.
