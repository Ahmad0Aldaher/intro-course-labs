 1) Fork of the Labs repository.

 Visit the Hosting tab and add a new site to begin the process. First link to GitHub account and define the ` "intro-course-labs"` repository that Fleek will have access to deploy.
 4) Select Internet Computer as the Deployment Location: we pick `IPFS` as the place where we want to host the website. The other option is `Internet Computer`

 We choose `master` branch for our case. There are other settings like (Framework, Docker image, Build command , Publish directory ) but we do not need these in our case.
