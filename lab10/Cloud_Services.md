To research Artifact Registries on AWS, GCP, and Azure, and document their key features, you can follow these steps:
# Task 1: Artifact Registries on AWS, GCP, and Azure

## AWS (Amazon Web Services)

### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- ECR is a fully-managed Docker container registry service provided by AWS.
- Key Features:
  - Seamless integration with Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Kubernetes.
  - Secure and private image storage with fine-grained access control.
  - High availability and redundancy for container images.
  - Image scanning for security vulnerabilities.
  - Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control.


## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Google Artifact Registry
- Artifact Registry is a container and language-agnostic artifact repository that works with popular build systems and package managers.
- Key Features:
  - Support for Docker containers, Maven, npm, and more.
  - Private and public repositories for managing artifacts.
  - Scalable and fully managed with Google Cloud's global network.
  - Integrated with Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).
  - Artifact versioning and metadata management.

## Microsoft Azure

### Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Azure Container Registry is a managed Docker registry service for storing and managing container images.
- Key Features:
  - Integration with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other container orchestration platforms.
  - Geo-replication for high availability and disaster recovery.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for image security.
  - Image scanning for vulnerabilities.
  - Webhooks for automation and integration.

# Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research
## AWS (Amazon Web Services)

### AWS Lambda
- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- Key Features:
  - Supports a variety of programming languages.
  - Event-driven architecture with automatic scaling.
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing, with no upfront costs.
  - Integration with a wide range of AWS services for serverless application development.
  - Customizable resource allocation and memory configuration.

### AWS Fargate
- While not strictly a serverless platform, AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that abstracts server management.
- Key Features:
  - Run containers without managing underlying EC2 instances.
  - Automatic scaling and resource allocation.
  - Integration with Amazon ECS for container orchestration.
  - Fine-grained control over container resources and networking.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Google Cloud Functions
- Google Cloud Functions is a lightweight, event-driven serverless compute service.
- Key Features:
  - Supports multiple programming languages.
  - Automatic scaling and resource provisioning.
  - Integrates with various GCP services and cloud events.
  - Event-driven architecture for serverless application development.
  - Pay only for the compute time you use.

### Google Cloud Run
- Google Cloud Run is a managed compute platform for containerized applications that abstracts server management.
- Key Features:
  - Run containerized applications in a serverless manner.
  - Automatic scaling and resource allocation.
  - Integrated with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for container orchestration.
  - Pay only for the compute time you use.
  - Ideal for microservices and web applications.


## Microsoft Azure

### Azure Functions
- Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure.
- Key Features:
  - Multiple programming language support.
  - Event-driven architecture with automatic scaling.
  - Integration with Azure services and custom triggers.
  - Fine-grained resource allocation.
  - Pay-per-execution pricing model.

### Azure App Service
- Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that simplifies building and deploying web and mobile apps.
- Key Features:
  - Supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks.
  - Autoscaling and load balancing.
  - Integration with Azure DevOps for CI/CD.
  - Built-in security and monitoring features.
  - PaaS benefits with serverless-like scalability.
